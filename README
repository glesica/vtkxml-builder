vtkxml-builder Readme
=====================

Author: George Lesica <george@lesica.com>

Description: A Python module for constructing VTK XML files for use with
ParaView and other data visualization software.

The code was inspired by
https://github.com/cfinch/Shocksolution_Examples/blob/master/Visualization/vtktools.py
though it has been completely rewritten.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be compiled by entering the "docs" directory and issuing
the following:

    make html

This will build the documentation in a directory called "build".

Tests
-----

Right now there are only a few doctests designed to catch major bugs. They can
be run with Nose:

    nosetests --with-doctest
